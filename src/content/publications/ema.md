**Abstract:**
Metadata annotation in digital collections is typically conducted by several specialized professionals, configuring a complex, labor-intensive, and time-consuming activity, leading to human failure, high costs, and problems in retrieving information accordingly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly Deep Learning techniques, have shown their potential in performing visual recognition and interpretation of objects on images. In this context, the present work introduces EMA, a Brazilian cultural heritage image dataset with over 11,000 labeled images of objects from seventeen Brazilian museums. [EMA dataset](https://github.com/AI-Unicamp/ema) is a contribution towards the development of automated metadata annotation tools. The paper also presents baseline ResNet50 results for the dataset, resulting in an over 86% recognition rate.
